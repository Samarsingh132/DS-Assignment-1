    "Ans. Lamdba function are generally used to use single line function in our code without creating any funtion\n",
    "but return single output means they have some limitation over normal major benefits of these are when we don't function\n",
    "more than once we prefer lambda function\n",

    " 1. Search for \"Download Python\"\n",
    " 2. Choose the first link and download latest version if not latest we can choose including the system we want to install\n",
    " 3. after downloading install it to desired path and just follow the instruction \n",
    " 4. After installation complete now we have to set path variable\n",
    " 5 To set path first open Python folder where it installed(C://Python310)\n",
    " 6 Copy this path and Open \"Edit the system environment variable\" by search on system or\n",
    " Right click on My Computer>Properties>> Advance System Setting>> Environment variable>>\n",
    " 7 Now on Environment Variable box we have two opton either \n",
    " set Python Path for User only or at whole System (if you go for system be carefull as one wrong move might affect working \n",
    " of system)\n",
    " 7 find \"path\" in click edit>> new >> path Python folder path here \n",
    " \n",
    " now check this by opening cmd and type \"python --version\" if it works then fine else need to fix the issue check internet and find where did we go wrong\n",
